"""
Patch to add progress tracking + cooperative cancel to batch inference in infer.py.

This patch:
1. Injects helper functions for writing ~/Applio/.applio/inference_progress.json
   (atomic os.replace writes, 0o600 perms), reading a cancel flag, and appending
   schema-compatible history entries to process_history.json (fcntl LOCK_EX,
   matching applio_launcher.add_to_history).
2. Rewrites VoiceConverter.convert_audio_batch to:
   - reject concurrent batches (status == "running"),
   - emit per-file progress (processed/converted/skipped/current_file),
   - cooperatively cancel via inference_cancel.flag (no PID kill),
   - append a completed/cancelled/error entry to process_history.json,
   - normalise terminal status (running->completed, cancelling->cancelled),
   - clear a stale cancel flag at start (robust against a stray Stop click).
   TOASTS: since upstream #1271/#1275 landed (merged 2026-08-25), the pristine
   convert_audio_batch fires its own toasts via a module-level _toast helper
   (start, 25/50/75% milestones, terminal, error). The rewrite KEEPS those
   upstream calls verbatim (the fork no longer injects _infer_toast - that
   would duplicate every announcement). Only the concurrent-run raise toast
   is fork-added: it sits BEFORE the body's try, so upstream's except-handler
   can never cover it.
3. Removes the broken infer_pid.txt logic (frozen-CWD write was wrong; and in
   single-process os.getpid() == the whole app, so PID-kill quit the app).
4. (a11y phase 4b) Wraps VoiceConverter.convert_audio's body in a try/except so
   SINGLE conversions also write start/terminal records into the same
   inference_progress.json (SSE-independent: the menu/dashboard/a11y payload
   see them even when the in-app WKWebView's toast stream is dead). The begin
   helper skips every write while a non-single record is running/cancelling, so
   a concurrent batch is never clobbered (and the batch loop's nested
   self.convert_audio calls become tracking no-ops via the same guard).

Modeled on patches/patch_refinegan_legacy_infer.py (same base_path arg contract:
opens os.path.join(base_path, "infer.py")).
